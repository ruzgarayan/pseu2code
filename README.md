## General Info
This is a project made in our second semester in Bilkent University. This project was the outcome of five individuals combined efforts. Each member has forked the project to show their involvement.

## Introduction
Pseu2Code is a program that helps developing algorithms. Pseu2Code helps the user organize his alghorithm into smaller more workable chunks. Our vision is to help users break complex alghoritms into smaller problems and solving them one at a time. After that, the users are given the opportunity of extracting the source code (of the chosen programming language) with their algorithm written as comments.
